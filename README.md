# refactoringmachine
The software was designed primarily to replace expressions inside files. It's a tool for programmers who want to change a large amount of code in many places at the same time. Instead of open each file and make the change, Refactoring Machine opens all the files and change the expression you want. The concept extends to file names and directory names. Enjoy it.
